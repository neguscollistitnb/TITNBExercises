/*
In average US Employees are obligated to pay around 35% in taxes if they are making $130000/year or more.

To find 35% of $130,000, you can multiply 130,000 by 0.35.
In mathematical terms:
35% of $130,000 = 130,000 * 0.35
So, 35% of $130,000 = $45,500
Therefore, 35% of $130,000 is equal to $45,500.
Write a program that stores the values of totalSalary and taxAmountDue with the most suitable data types. Then create a takeHomeAmount variable where the value is the difference between totalSalary and taxAmountDue. End the program with printing out the value of takeHomeAmount.
____ totalSalary = ____;
_____ taxAmountDue = ____;
_____ takeHomeAmount = ____;

System.out.println(takeHomeAmount);
